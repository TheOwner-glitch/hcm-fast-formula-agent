Inputs required for the calculation are the hire date, effective date, ceiling value, and method.\n3. Years of service are calculated by finding the difference in months between the effective date and hire date, then dividing by 12 and rounding down.\n4. The base accrual rate is determined based on the years of service:\n   - 0 years: 0 accrual\n   - 1-4 years: 10 accrual\n   - 5-9 years: 15 accrual\n   - 10+ years: 20 accrual\n5. The accrual rate is adjusted for part-time hours by scaling it based on the ratio of working hours to standard hours (40 hours).\n6. If a ceiling value is specified and the adjusted accrual exceeds it, the final accrual is capped at the ceiling value.\n7. If the method is set to 'MANUAL', the final accrual is forced to be 0.\n8. The final accrual value is returned as the output of the formula.\n\nIn summary, this Fast Formula calculates an employee's vacation accrual based on their years of service, working hours, and any specified limits or overrides, providing the final accrual value that should be applied.", "duration": 2.36, "user": "julio"}
