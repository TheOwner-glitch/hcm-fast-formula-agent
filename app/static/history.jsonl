The base accrual rate is determined based on the years of service:\n   - 0 years: 0 accrual\n   - 1-4 years: 10 accrual\n   - 5-9 years: 15 accrual\n   - 10+ years: 20 accrual\n5. The accrual rate is adjusted for part-time hours by scaling it based on the ratio of working hours to standard hours (40 hours).\n6. The adjusted accrual rate is compared to the specified ceiling, if any, and capped at the ceiling if it exceeds it.\n7. An optional method override allows setting the final accrual to 0 if the method is 'MANUAL'.\n8. The final accrued value is returned as the output of the formula.\n\nIn summary, this Fast Formula calculates an employee's vacation accrual based on their years of service, working hours, and any specified limits or method overrides, providing the final accrued value for the employee's vacation time.", "duration": 4.09, "user": "julio"}

IV_HIRE_DATE: The date the employee was hired.\n2. IV_EFFECTIVE_DATE: The date the calculation is effective from.\n3. IV_CEILING: A numerical value that sets the maximum limit for the vacation accrual.\n4. IV_METHOD: A text value that can override the calculation method.\n\nThe formula first calculates the years of service by finding the difference in months between the effective date and the hire date, and dividing by 12. The FLOOR function is used to round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe base vacation accrual is then set based on the years of service. If the years of service is less than 1, the accrual is 0. If it's between 1 and 5 years, the accrual is 10. If it's between 5 and 10 years, the accrual is 15. If it's 10 years or more, the accrual is 20.\n\nThe formula then adjusts the base accrual for part-time hours. It does this by multiplying the base accrual by the ratio of the employee's normal working hours to the standard 40 hours.\n\nNext, the formula enforces the ceiling value. If a ceiling value is provided and the adjusted accrual exceeds this ceiling, the final accrual is set to the ceiling value. Otherwise, the final accrual is the adjusted accrual.\n\nThe formula also allows for an optional method override. If the method input is 'MANUAL', the final accrual is set to 0, overriding any previous calculations.\n\nFinally, the formula returns the final accrual value. This is the amount of vacation accrual for the employee based on their years of service, working hours, and any provided ceiling or method override.", "duration": 17.82, "user": "julio"}
