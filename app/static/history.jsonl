If an employee\u2019s salary is above $120,000, deduct a 3% high-income tax.\r\n2. If the salary is between $80,000 and $120,000, deduct 2% mid-income tax.\r\n3. If the salary is below $80,000, deduct 1% low-income tax.\r\n4. Additionally, if the employee is in the state of California (CA), apply an extra $50 state fee.\r\n5. If the employee\u2019s job grade is \u201cMGR\u201d or higher, add a $500 executive bonus.\r\n6. Return the final net pay as:  \r\n   Net Pay = Salary - Taxes - State Fee + Executive Bonus\r\n\r\nInclude default values for each input.\r\nMake sure the formula returns NET_PAY.\r\nInclude inline comments for clarity.\nInputs: SALARY (120000), STATE (GA), GRADE (MGR)\nBefore each logic block, add a plain-English comment explaining what the block does.\nReturn the formula with detailed comments for readability.", "response": "Certainly!
