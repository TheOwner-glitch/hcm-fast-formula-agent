The start date is set to January 1, 1951, and the normal working hours are set to 40.\n\nThe formula then takes four inputs: the hire date (IV_HIRE_DATE), the effective date (IV_EFFECTIVE_DATE), a ceiling value (IV_CEILING), and a method (IV_METHOD). \n\nThe formula first calculates the years of service by finding the number of months between the effective date and the hire date, and dividing this by 12. The FLOOR function is used to round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe base accrual of vacation time is then set based on the years of service. If the years of service is less than 1, the base accrual is 0. If it's between 1 and 5 years, the base accrual is 10. If it's between 5 and 10 years, the base accrual is 15. If it's 10 years or more, the base accrual is 20.\n\nThe formula then adjusts the base accrual for part-time hours. It does this by multiplying the base accrual by the ratio of the employee's working hours to the standard 40 hours.\n\nNext, the formula enforces a ceiling on the accrual. If a positive ceiling value is provided and the adjusted accrual exceeds this ceiling, the final accrual is set to the ceiling value. Otherwise, the final accrual is the adjusted accrual.\n\nThe formula then checks if the method input is 'MANUAL'. If it is, the final accrual is set to 0, overriding any previous calculations.\n\nFinally, the formula returns the final accrual. This is the amount of vacation time, in hours, that the employee accrues."}
